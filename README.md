## Web Retrieval and Mining Final Project

To run this project:

```bash
# frontend
cd frontend
# if you use yarn (recommended)
yarn install
yarn build
# if you use npm (not tested before)
npm install
npm run build

# backend
cd backend
python3 server.py
```

Also make sure static files (media files, lyrics files, poem files) are located in the right place.
(Modify those directories in `backend/server.py` if needed.)
